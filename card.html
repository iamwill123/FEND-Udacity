			<p>BUB is a very special one of a kind critter. More specifically, she is the most amazing cat on the planet. In July of 2011, she was discovered as the runt of a healthy feral litter in a tool shed in rural Indiana at only a few weeks old. She was taken in as a rescue when it was clear that she would require special care. Since then BUB has become one of the most famous cats on planet. She is a published author, a talk show host, the star of an award winning documentary, created Lil BUB's Big FUND for the ASPCA (the first national fund for special needs pets), and has helped raise over $300,000 for animals in need.</p>
